| 1-23     | 34   |                        | Write a program to remove all comments from a C program. Don't forget to handle quoted strings and character constants properly.

| 1-24     | 4    |                        | Write a program to check a C program for rudimentary syntax errors like unbalanced parentheses, brackets and braces.<br>Don't forget about quotes, both single and double, escape sequences, and comments.

| 3-1      |      |          | Our binary search makes two tests inside the loop, when one would suffice (at the price of more tests outside). Write a version with only one test inside the loop and measure the difference in run-time.                                                                                                                              |
| 3-2      |      |          | Write a function `escape(s, t)` that converts characters like newline and tab into visible escape sequences like `\n` and `\t` as it copies the string `t` to `s`.<br>Use a `switch`. Write a function for the other direction as well, coverting escape sequences into the real characters.                                            |
| 3-3      |      |          | Write a function `expand(s1, s2)` that expands shorhand notations like `a-z` in the string `s1` into the equivalent complete list `abc...xyz` in `s2`.<br>Allow for letters of either case and digits, and be prepared to handle cases like `a-b-c` and `a-z0-9` and `-a-z`. Arrange that a leading or trailing `-` is taken literally. |
| 3-4      |      |          | In a two's complement number representation, our version of `itoa` does not handle the largest negative number, that is, the value of `n` equal to `-(2^{wordsize-1})`.<br>Explain why not. Modify it to print that value correctly, regardless of the machine on which it runs.                                                        |
| 3-5      |      |          | Write the function `itob(n, s, b)` that converts the integer `n` into a base `b` character representation in the string `s`. In particalar, `itob(n, s, 16)` formats `n` as a hexadecimal integer in `s`.                                                                                                                               |
| 3-6      |      |          | Write a version of `itoa` that accepts three arguments instead of two.<br>The third argument is a minimum field width; the converted number must be padded with blanks on the left if necessary to make it wide enough.                                                                                                                 |

| -------- | ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4-1      |      |          | Write the function `strrindex(s, t)`, which returns the position of the **rightmost** occurrence of `t` in `s`, or `-1` if there is none.                               |
| 4-2      |      |          | Extend `atof` to handle scientific notation of the form `123.45e-6` where a floating-point number may be followed by `e` or `E` and an optionally signed exponent.      |
| 4-3      |      |          | Given the basic framework, it's straightforward to extend the calculator. Add the modulus (`%`) and provisions for negative numbers.                                    |
| 4-4      |      |          | Add commands to print the top element of the stack without poping, to duplicate it, and to swap the top two elements. Add a command to clear the stack.                 |
| 4-5      |      |          | Add access to library functions like `sin`, `exp` and `pow`. See `<math.h>` in Appendix B, Section 4.                                                                   |
| 4-6      |      |          | Add commands for handling variables. (It's easy to provide twenty-six variables with single-letter names.) Add a variable for the most recently printed value.          |
| 4-7      |      |          | Write a routine `ungets` that will push back an entire string onto the input. Should `ungets` know about `buf` and `bufp`, or should it just use `ungetch`?             |
| 4-8      |      |          | Supppose that there will never be more than one character of pushback. Modify `getch` and `ungetch` accordingly.                                                        |
| 4-9      |      |          | Our `getch` and `ungetch` do not handle a pushed-back `EOF` correctly. Decide what their properties ougth to be if an `EOF` is pushed back, then implement your design. |
| 4-10     |      |          | An alternative organization uses `getline` to read an entire input line; this makes `getch` and `ungetch` unnecessary. Revise the calculator to use this appproach.     |
| 4-11     |      |          | Modify `getop` so that it doesn't need to use `ungetch`. Hint: use an internal `static` variable.                                                                       |
| 4-12     |      |          | Adapt the ideas of `printd` to write a recursive version of `itoa`; that is, convert an integer into a string by calling a recursive routine.                           |
| 4-13     |      |          | Write a recursive version of the function `reverse(s)`, which reverse the string `s` in place.                                                                          |
| 4-14     |      |          | Define a macro `swap(t, x, y)` that interchanges two arguments of type `t`. (Block structure will help.)                                                                |

| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5-1      |      |          | As written, `getint` treats a `+` or `-` not followed by a digit as a valid representation of zero. Fix it to push such a character back on the input.                                                                                                                                      |
| 5-2      |      |          | Write `getfloat`, the floating-point analog of `getint`. What type does `getfloat` return as its function value?                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5-3      |      |          | Write a pointer version of the function `strcat` that we showed in Chapter 2: `strcat(s, t)` copies the string `t` to the end of `s`.                                                                                                                                                       |
| 5-4      |      |          | Write the function `strend(s, t)`, which returns 1 if the string `t` occurs at the end of the string `s`, and zero otherwise.                                                                                                                                                               |
| 5-5      |      |          | Write the version of the library functions `strncpy`, `strncat`, and `strncmp`, which operate on at most the first `n` characters of their arguement strings.<br>For example, `strncpy(s, t, n)` copies at most `n` characters of `t` to `s`. Full descriptions are in Appendix B.          |
| 5-6      |      |          | Rewrite appropriate programs from earlier chapters and exercises with ponters instead of array indexing.<br>Good possibilites include `getline` (Chapter 1 and 4), `atoi`, `itoa`, and their variants (Chapter 2, 3, and 4), `reverse` (Chapter 3), and `strindex` and `getop` (Chapter 4). |
| 5-7      |      |          | Rewrite `readlines` to store lines in an array supplied by `main`, rather than calling `alloc` to maintain storage. How much faster is the program?                                                                                                                                         |
| 5-8      |      |          | There is no error checking in `day_of_year` or `month_day`. Remedy this defect.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 5-9      |      |          | Rewrite the routines `day_of_year` and `month_day` with pointers instead of indexing.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
